In this particular project an add button and a text box is made with the help of js,html and css

-> The main functionality of the project is when the text is added in the text box and we click on the 'add' button 
   the particular text which was written int the text box is appended to the <p> tag.

->Similarly if multiple text are added those texts are appended in the multiple <p> tags and they are added one below 
  the another.

 -> In this task, the addEventListener method is used to listen for the "click" event on the "Add" button. When the button is clicked, the entered text is retrieved from the text input 
  (textInput), and if the text is not empty, a new element is created using the document.createElement("p"), the text content is set, and it's appended to the outputContainer div using the 
   appendChild method.
